{"name":"iOS Notes Export","tagline":"Small Utility to export iOS notes to CSV file","body":"# ios-note-export\r\n\r\nSimple tool that can be used export notes from (unencrypted) iTunes backup files to CSV files.\r\nAs Apple does not provide a mechanism for exporting notes, I found myself facing the daunting\r\ntask of copying and pasting hundreds of notes. Instead, I switched my iTunes backup to be\r\nunencrypted and performed a plain text search of the database and found the notes to be in\r\nSQLite format.\r\n\r\n# Pre-requisites:\r\n\r\nYou should have iTunes installed for the user executing the export tool, and that iTunes\r\nshould be synched to the iPhone/iPad in question. The backup should NOT be encrypted. If it\r\nis encrypted, be sure to switch of encryption then re-sync.\r\n\r\n# Usage:\r\n\r\n1) Make sure you have a JRE installed : http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp<br/>\r\n2) If Windows User, double click \"iOS Note Exporter.exe\". If on other platforms, double click the .jar file.<br/>\r\n3) Select the folder containing the backup .... <br/>\r\n      If on Windows, the iTunes backup folder is <<User Folder>>/AppData/Roaming/Apple Computer/...<br/>\r\n      If on OSX, then iTunes backup folder is usually : ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/<br/> \r\n4) If notes are found, select a folder to output the CSVs.<br/>\r\n5) Finished.\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\n * Copyright 2012 Consoli Limited\r\n * \r\n * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\r\n * contributor license agreements.
